Hi! first and foremost thanks for buying this asset! 

I strongly recommend you to read the User manual, starting with the section "Importing the package", this will allow you to easily set up Kinematic 2D (don't worry you only need to load two presets into your project, inputs and layers).
Once the package is imported check the "Walkthough" section, it covers some basic aspects of the asset (Core + Implementation), demonstration of features, a bunch of recommendations and side notes.

The official documentation of Kinematic 2D ("User Manual" and "Release Notes") is online (i'm using Google Docs). You can find the latest version of the User Manual (pdf version) inside the Documentation folder.
